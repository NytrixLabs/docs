As you know from the previous page, Severn is a Discord and a Fluxer bot. This page documents the **Discord** edition of Severn.

# Important information

Here is some things everyone using Severn should know:

- The prefix is `v!`.

  <Frame>
    ![Screenshot of a user saying v!ping to a bot named Severn.](/images/severnpingexample.png)
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

- Severn is in **alpha** and is VERY buggy.

# Installation

Severn can be installed in 2 ways. They are:

- Administrator Install
- Fine-grained Install

**_I strongly recommend the Administrator Install, see below for more._**

### What does Administrator Install mean?

Administrator Install means you grant the bot (Severn) the Administrator permission. 
<Warning>
  Administrator is a **dangerous** permission to grant!
</Warning>

The only upside to this is that you **do not** have to kick and re-add Severn to your server when it needs a new permission.

### What does Fine-grained Install mean? 

Fine-grained Install means the bo will only be given the permissions it **requires** to work properly.

<Info>This is the safest route for large servers.</Info>

The only downside to this is that you **have to** have to kick and re-add Severn to your server when it needs a new permission.
